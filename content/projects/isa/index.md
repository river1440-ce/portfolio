# Background

During the last quarter of **my exchange in Indian Institute of Technology, Madras**, I took this course,  MS5561 (Information Systems Analysis), to learn more about software product development. Within one and half month, our 8-people team came up with the project idea, “Project Log Platform", estimated tasks dependency, analyzed the project requirements, finished the high level, and provide a draft for the UI (user interface).

# Goal

Within one and half month, purpose a software project including **project proposition, requirement analysis, high-level system design, and future plan (including UI and testing strategy).**

# Process

## 1. Project Idea Cooked - Purposing and filtering idea candidates

It is a course requirement from the professor to have a team size around 8 peoples, which raise a challenge to collaborate, especially for our team - **while other teams mainly MBA students, our team has PhD students, MS students, students from industrial park, and exchange student (which is me).**

Thus, to facilitate idea purposing, I first set a Google sheet for all team members to easily and freely share their project idea, (Figure 1.), then had a meeting with all members, which for whom proposed the ideas could share their thought, and end up with a idea vote.

## 2. Project framing - Choosing project model and analyze task dependency

After we decided the idea, it is essential to assign roles to every member, and define clear responsibility, to ensure such a big team could follow the product development schedule. The role assigning is also coordinated by a Google sheet, where I first list the roles based on the final project sections, then have a meeting with all members to pick a job. To consider about personal preference, job which be picked by more than one people could ask for a negotiation. Figure 2 shows part of the role list with the responsibilities extracted from the final project sections.

As the project idea is purposed by me, I take the role to define the project scope, including involving stakeholders and project objectives. In addition, I also take charge in selecting the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model, and analyze the tasks dependency.

As the project idea is straightforward, **I took the V-lifecycle Model, which is supposed to accelerate the development speed as both project definition and project testing and validation run in parallel.**  (Figure 3)

As a requirement from the course, the network diagram is used to **analyze the tasks dependency**, with the task which depend on another task should be deal with later and get pointed by that task. Figure 4 shows the network diagram and part of the task table.

The final value proposition of the project is shown in Figure 5, which is a slide borrowed from our final presentation.
